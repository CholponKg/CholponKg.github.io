   	<h2>My Country &mdash; Kyrgyzstan</h2>

		<li>I am from sunny Central Asian Country Kyrgyzstan. This beautiful land with untouched nature
	borders with Kazahstan from North, China from South, Uzbekistan from East and Russia from West. 
	Our ancestors were nomadic tribes who chose the greatest pasturelands during summer and more down
	mountain valleys during winter. The warrior spirit of Kyrgyz people definetely comes from our ancestors
	who were not afraid of their invadors and foght till the last drop of their blood.

		<li>Since we are landlocked country, most of the income we get from agriculture and rapidly growing
		textile industry. Another resource which is contributing greatly to the country's GDP - Gold Mining 
		Industry run by international company. Having a beautiful and untouched nature is giving us a big opportunity 
		to develop the Tourism. With today's technology there are more chances to spread information about the tourism 
		in our country.
